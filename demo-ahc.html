                <h3>History</h3>
                <p>David Albert Huffman is a well known computer scientist who notably developed
                    the lossless compression technique named Huffman coding. <a href="https://www.huffmancoding.com/my-uncle/scientific-american">Reportedly</a>, Huffman created this
                    coding method to avoid taking a final exam on information theory. This technique utilizes
                    frequency information known about the data to create prefix codes for each symbol,
                    where the more frequently used symbols have shorter codes, while the seldom used characters
                    have longer codes. The way that these codes are generated is by creating a binary tree in a
                    specific manner such that each symbol is located at a leaf node in the tree and higher frequency
                    symbols have shorter paths to the root of the tree. Zero is assigned to left side branches while
                    one is assigned to right side branches. The prefix codes can then be determined by recording the
                    ones and zeroes seen while traversing from the root to a particular node. The downside to this
                    technique is that both the encoder and decoder need to have the information about the symbol
                    frequencies to generate the same prefix codes. Such a method cannot be used effectively in
                    scenarios where the whole data set is not known in advance.
                    <br /><br />
                    To address this, a technique called adaptive Huffman coding was created. Rather than using
                    known frequency information to generate a static tree, the tree is updated after each character
                    is encoded/decoded. The dynamic nature of this variation on Huffman coding is suitable for
                    networking applications, but suffers from sensitivity to bit errors. Although adaptive Huffman
                    coding may not be very popular, some form of Huffman coding is used in a variety of
                    compression applications including GZIP, PKZIP, JPEG, and MPEG.
                </p>
                <h3>FGK Algorithm</h3>
                <p>Adaptive Huffman coding has two main algorithms: FGK (Faller-Gallager-Knuth) and Vitter. The Vitter
                    algorithm is an improvement on the FGK algorithm. This demo uses FGK, so it will be focused on.
                    First, a binary tree is initialized. Each node on this tree should hold a weight and optionally
                    a symbol. Only leaf nodes should contain symbols. The root of the tree should initially have a
                    node with a Not-Yet-Transferred (NYT) symbol and a weight of zero (also called the zero node).
                    The weight of this node should never increase. When a symbol that has not yet been transferred
                    is sent, the encoder finds sends the code for the NYT symbol and then a fixed length code for
                    the symbol. The code for any symbol on the tree is obtained by traversing the path from the root
                    to the symbol's node, where left side branches are represented by '0' and right side branches are
                    represented by '1.' After a new symbol is sent, the node that the NYT symbol spawns two child nodes
                    where the left child is the new location of the NYT symbol and the right child is the node for
                    the new symbol. The weight of the leaf nodes is the number of times that symbol has been seen.
                    The weights of non-leaf nodes are the sums of their child nodes' weights.
                    <br /><br />
                    Once the weights of each node are updated, the encoder must check whether the sibling property
                    of the tree has been violated. The sibling property is that each node of the tree has
                    monotonically non-decreasing weights when read left to right, bottom to top. If there is a
                    violation of this property, the node whose update violated the property is swapped with the furthest
                    node with weight one less than the other node. Multiple swaps may need to occur before the
                    sibling property is restored.
                </p>
                <h3>About this Demo</h3>
                <p>To use this demo, type a string of text into the input box. As you type, the tree will adjust
                    itself and the corresponding output symbols will be shown in the output box. It is best to
                    use this application on a display that is at least 1920x1080. Note that the more you use a
                    character, the shorter the output code tends to be.
